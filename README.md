A 3D model wireframe viewer with some interactivity in javascript using canvas element.

Saw this in one of [Tsoding's](https://www.youtube.com/@Tsoding) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjWkNZ0SXfo) and decided to have some fun in it.
Added resizing and .obj file loading as well as some interactivity.

Plan to add some more stuff like some UI elements.

.obj file used to test is included (Socrates.obj) which was aquired from [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/socrates-obj-e2335a0d0a754ffabc031c02326913a2#download) (not my work, all credits to RomarovArt on sketchfab for the model)
